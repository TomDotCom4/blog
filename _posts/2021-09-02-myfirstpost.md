Not much to this blog post, I am just sharing 5 YouTube channels that have provided value to me and will hopefully do the same for you. This is in no particular order. This only serves as a means of getting this blog off the ground, though you should check everything out in here that you can because it's quite fantastic.

Also note that there will be formatting issues and a few other things that really could be better with this blog. If you are looking at this website around the day of its release, consider this the "alpha" version.

## Economics Explained
I promise that this won't be as boring as it sounds. Good channel that pretty much does what it says in its name and manages to do so in a way that people less familiar with economics can comprehend. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/1HmGLV46L60">this video is a good example of some of this channel's best work</a>.

## Techlore
YouTube channel that is bringing digital privacy and security to the masses. Lots of excellent resources you can do to help stamp out the spying and compromise of your online data. <a href="https://youtu.be/u8_9AQYLSbo">This video is a good start for anyone new to this</a>. If you really want to go all in on learning this though, Techlore has a <a href="https://techlore.tech/goincognito.html">4.5 hour free course</a> on how to protect yourself online.

## Ali Abdaal
Productivity and occasionally a finance YouTuber. Bit too much of an Apple fan but overall has good content that contains actionable steps you can take to better yourself. Also was part of the inspiration for me to actually make this blog in the first place with <a href="https://youtu.be/nAXY89s0t4E">this video</a>.

## Green Ham Gaming
One of my favourite tech channels on YouTube, though not necessarily for the information, but the artistic value behind it. Uploads extremely rarely as of this post, but it is aways worth a watch. I recommend starting with <a href="https://youtu.be/7SjRZaV6_B0">"Time: a smartwatch film"</a>.

## Snazzy Labs
Fun and informative channel that is somewhat Apple focused but covers a wide range of things. Lots of educational value in his videos and is actually entertaining too. All his videos are pretty good, so start with whatever you think is the most interesting.
