In a world where online accounts are being compromised left right and centre, it is more critical than ever that we keep our digital footprints as small as reasonably possible. One such method of doing this is deleting the accounts that you do not need anymore in your life, which greatly lessens your chance of being involved in a data breach. Upon following this guide you will:

- Have many unneeded online accounts deleted.
- Have far greater control and a better picture of your online presence thanks to your use of Bitwarden.
- Peace of mind knowing that much less of your data is not sprawling in every dark corner of the internet.

Be warned, though you will have more organisation deleting accounts with my method, you will likely still have a long road ahead. Don't feel like you are moving too slowly or that you have barely made a dent in any of your accounts. This is a process I've been doing for close to a year still have little bits and pieces to round up. It will feel daunting, but it will only get less daunting if you get started on this journey.

<br>

### Things You Need

- <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> or similar service with Kanban board feature (You can delete the account easily when you are done).
- <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> or another password manager (Bitwarden is much preferred as it is verifiably secure thanks to its open source nature, while Lastpass, Dashlane and others are closed source, meaning that their code isn't visible and their security isn't verifiable).
- OPTIONAL - A Desktop PC (Things will be easier here than on a Mobile Phone. An iPad would be OK too).

<br>

### Pre-reading Requirement

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, you should read over these instructions on <a href="https://todoist.com/help/articles/visualize-your-workflow-with-board-view">making Kanban boards in Todoist</a> and these guides from Bitwarden about making <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/managing-items/">account entries</a> and <a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/folders/">folders</a> as will be utilising these features, and there is no point in me explaining them when there are official sources with better explanations.

<br>

### Setting up the Foundation of the Operation

First, you need to gather all of your accounts into one place. This is where your password manager comes in. Look through your email inbox(es) for words like “welcome” “sign up” “confirm” “unsubscribe” and anything else to see what services you have signed up for and record their information inside your password manager. Do this until you have everything that you can possibly think of so that all of your accounts and their details are in one centralised space and are thus easier to visualise.

You also need to make a Kanban board in Todoist and add a column for every email and email alias you have as well as an extra column called "Deleted". If you aren't keen on typing out several of your emails inside TOdoist, just find a way to identify them without typing the email and title your columns that way (e.g if you have 2 Gmail accounts and a ProtonMail account, you could title the columns G1, G2 and P respectively).

Make a new folder in Bitwarden as per the guide you read above (you did read it, didn't you?) and then make a folder called "to be deleted" and move all of your accounts to be deleted into it. This isn't a strictly necessary step, but it is good housekeeping and will help keep you organised and not too scatterbrained later on, very handy if you have hundreds of accounts to delete.

<br>

### WARNING! Read this before proceeding with the steps beyond this section!

When you delete an account, it is more than like that every piece of data and every purchase you made on that service will no longer be accessible (well,<a href="https://youtu.be/oHCK3NKFBW4?t=459"> unless youre Discord!</a>). This means you will no longer see any of the data or be able to access it. Make sure you download all of your data from these services before deleting them if you care about it, especially social media and financial services. <a href="https://justgetmydata.com/">justgetmydata.com</a>) is a directory of links that will help you easily download your data from the most popular services, but for other services not on here, you will have to search for the method that the website you want the data from uses, if any at all. I am not responsible if you accidentally lose data that is very important or necessary to you.

<br>

### The Account Deletion Procedure

These steps that I am about to outline are to be repeated for every account that you have to delete for maximum effectiveness.

Visit <a href="https://justdeleteme.xyz/">justdeleteme.xyz</a>) and check if the account you want to delete is in the list. If so, your life has just been made a lot easier. If not though, simply look up the method in which you delete the account on the support page on the website. Be warned that some websites will try and hide this information as a means of keeping you with their service, do not fall for it.

<br>

**If the account that you are going to delete is a simple one click operation** (e.g. <a href="https://justdeleteme.xyz/#imdb">IMDb</a>) or requires a couple of small steps, then simple take part in those steps to delete the account and then move its relevant Bitwarden entry into the recycle bin.

**If the account requires extra steps, usually in the form of contacting the company**, then contact the company from the email that you signed up to their service/website with and copy and paste the following, ensuring that you replace the square bracketed values with their necessary contents:

<br>

*Subject: Account Deletion Request -* [Service/Website Name]

*Greetings,*

*I am requesting that you delete my account with* [Name of Account you are deleting]*. The account exists under the same email with which I am contacting you now. I understand the consequences of this action and am willing to proceed with the account and data deletion process.*

*Thanks.*

<br>

This will help in eliminating any follow up questions, most of which ask you if you are sure you want to delete it. You should also contact support anyway, even if the company doesn't explicitly state their method of account deletion on their website. Once you've done this, make a new entry under the relevant email column in your Kanban board on Todoist and simply write the name of the service. Then when you have confirmation your account is deleted, move the entry over to the "deleted" column you made.

**If the account is impossible to delete**, move the entry for that account in Bitwarden into a new folder called "undeletable" to signify that it can't be deleted at this time. If the company every has a change of heart and honours these requests officially, or your country passes some sort of "right to be forgotten" legislation, then you can use either to your advantage on those once stubborn businesses to delete your account with them.

Now you need to repeat the account deletion procedure for every account. Like I said above, this is daunting, but if you have 100 accounts to delete and delete one account a day, you will only take 100 days.

<br>

### The End

Congratulations, you now have a password manager, a better picture of the accounts you have in your posession and the data thats out there and a strongly minimised digital footprint that will assist in lowering your chance of being involved in a data breach online. If you know anyone who needs this, you should consider sharing this with them because the fewer accounts and services we use, the safer we all are in the end.
