EFTPOS Australia announced a very futuristic new way to pay for goods. A way to spend your hard earned money in any store and have automatic contributution to your loyalty cards like Flybuys and save a digital copy of your receipt, all of which is done simply by scanning a QR code. Sounds awesome doesn’t it? Well if you value your human right to privacy, you really shouldn't use it.

If you want my evidence as to why this is, look no further than [EFTPOS Australia’s own website](https://www.eftposaustralia.com.au/payment-solutions/payment-solutions-for-business/eftpos-qr) about it. Part of the opportunity they advertise to customers with this new payment technology is “deeper customer engagement” through “connect[ing] with them across more touchpoints.” This is easily translatable into "we are hungry for more of your personal financial data and want to find more ways to manipulate how you spend your money". EFTPOS Australia and the merchants that use it will be able to track you across various stores and make a very good individual profile of you through tracking the following:

- Loyalty cards you use
- Receipts
- The items you buy and where you bought them from
- The payment methods you use (gift card, buy now pay later etc).
- The information you use to sign up, likely involving address, name, phone number email and potentially more.

You will be targeted by offers and big corporations will have greater leverage and control over you to get your business, not to mention we don’t know how far that information might go either, and whose hands it ends up in. You could argue this already happens now, and you’d be exactly right, but the surveillance will be exacerbated enormously when you use a service like this one.

If you would like your freedom back, I encourage you to avoid using digital payment methods (EFTPOS QR, buy now pay later services, debit and credit cards) and spend physical cash or gift cards bought with physical cash. Several banks such as Macquarie Bank in Australia offer free ATM withdrawals at Big 4 banks which will help tremendously in spending cash instead of using digital payment.

Resistance against this technology may feel futile and probably is given how swiftly [Australia is turning into a cashless economy](https://7news.com.au/business/finance/covid-19-speeds-up-shunning-of-cash-in-aus-c-2278544), but we need to slow its rise as much as possible through spending physical cash.
