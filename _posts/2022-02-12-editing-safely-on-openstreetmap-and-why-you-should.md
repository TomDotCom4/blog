# OSM SAFE EDITING GUIDE

In the modern world, one of the biggest Google services that people can't get away from easily is Google Maps. This is because Google Maps is one of the richest companies on earth, so it is very difficult for competition to rise up. Luckily for us, something beautiful, much less invasive and superior on a technical level exist called OpenStreetMap.

The best way to describe OpenStreetMap is that it is like Google Maps in that it is a digital map, but it also resembles Wikipedia through the methods that it gets data in as it is the userbase of OpenStreetMap that puts all the data in. One of the unfortunate things about OpenStreetMap is that it struggles immensely to compete with the near monopoly Google has over mapping software. Luckily, seeing as you have stumbled upon this post (or I sent it to you) I am going to tell you:

- Why OpenStreetMap is important & the benefits of using it.
- How to make edits on OpenStreetMap in a way that keeps your identity separate from your edits.
- How to protect your OpenStreetMap account from the effects of a data breaches.
- Direct you to resources on how to view and edit in OpenStreetMap.

What I am not going to tell you is yhow to actually make edits. There is a very good interactive tutorial on the official website once you get started and the knowledge you gain there can be transferred to other OSM editors.

## WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT

It would be very easy for me to parrot a few small points, but I will leave here a few good links I like on the topic.

[Why OpenStreetMap?](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FAQ#Why_OpenStreetMap.3F)

[Why Would You Use OpenStreetMap when there is Google Maps?](https://geoawesomeness.com/why-would-you-use-openstreetmap-if-there-is-google-maps/)

If you want the abridged version though, I will do my best.

- Google Maps puts draconian licensing around their mapping software, including the prohibition of the use of their mapping data in other mapping solutions. They also prohibit you from downloading their maps, making it impossible to use if you have no connection which is unlike Google maps

- Control over how you view your maps. Many clients exist for map viewing and editing including
    - [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) | Browsers. Can view and edit.
    - [Qwant Maps](https://www.qwant.com/maps) | Browsers. Can view. My preferred option for viewing.
    - [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) | iOS and Android. Can view.
    - [Go Map!!](https://apps.apple.com/app/id592990211) [](https://osmand.net/)| Can edit.
    - [VesPucci](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.blau.android) [](https://osmand.net/)| Can edit.
    
    Google restricts you to just using their software and submitting edits to them, which may not get accepted. Several big entities also use this data including Wikipedia and even Apple.
    
- Avoid Google Spying. This one is fairly self explanatory, but in case it isn't, watch this TED talk from Glenn Greenwald. [https://youtu.be/pcSlowAhvUk](https://youtu.be/pcSlowAhvUk)

Like I said, these are the tip of the iceberg. Please read the articles I sent to get a very good idea of the benefits and drawbacks.

## Making An Account

If you want to be as safe as possible making an account, I recommend you use a service called [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/). This will allow you to make an email alias not tied to your real identity that forwards to your normal email inbox. The reason I recommend this is so that if you get involved in a data breach, your real email isn't exposed and tied to all the edits you made, which are public and tied to your account.

You also need to pick a username that is not tied to your identity, or any of your other online accounts as to ensure that your edits can remain anonymous. Imagine the consequences of making an edit on your house and your username contains your real name. Someone could find you and cause you harm. It’s unlikely, but it’s a very easy precaution that you should always take.

As for passwords, this should be a long randomly generated string of text that can be generated and stored in a password manager like Bitwarden or KeepassXC. As there are sadly no 2 factor authentication options, you need to make up for this with a long password that not even you are able to know by heart.

## Making Edits in OpenStreetMap

As mentioned earlier, I won’t be actually showing you how to make edits as the official OpenStreetMap website shows that effectively. I will be giving you links to some resources though to give you this information, so I invite you to indulge on said links below:

- [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) | If you’re not sure of an edit before making it, I encourage you to start here. Heck, you should have a gander anyway solely to avoid a couple of beginner mistakes, like not putting phone numbers into international format.
- [OpenStreetMap Discord Servers](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Discord) | Several Discord servers which are linked on this page on their wiki. It includes some nation specific servers as well an international server for the use of anyone in a country not listed.

Please share this with people who don’t understand why Google Maps is very evil. Together we can make OpenStreetMap a more viable alternative to Google Maps.
