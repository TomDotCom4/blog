Hi everyone,

I am TomDotCom, a guy with a passion for online privacy, security, and freedom and the bulk of these posts will be about these topics. There may also be the odd post about something else, so stay tuned for those too.

I am also a big fan of several projects and will often bring these up with good reason. Such projects include but won't be limited to [Signal](https://signal.org/), a secure and private messenger, email aliasing service [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/), and decentralised digital currency [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/).

If you would like to follow this blog, you may do so by putting this link below into your RSS Reader. If you don't know what an RSS reader is, there will be a blog post linked here soon about it, but for now, watch this video about it [here.](https://youtu.be/6HNUqDL-pI8)
